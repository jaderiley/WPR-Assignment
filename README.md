## Reflection (optional)
Throughout the development of PixelVerse, our team gained valuable experience in collaborative web development using Node.js and Express. We learned how to structure a scalable Express application, manage dynamic data, and create a cohesive retro-themed user interface with EJS and CSS3. 

Some challenges we faced included synchronizing work across different roles  and handling in-memory data for contact submissions. Debugging route issues and maintaining a consistent retro aesthetic were also key learning points.

In the future, we would like to implement persistent data storage (e.g., a database), add user authentication, and expand the event system with real-time features. We are proud of the teamwork and creativity that went into this project and look forward to building on this foundation.
